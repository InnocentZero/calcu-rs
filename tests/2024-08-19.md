# python

## Simple Operations

Python has the capability of carrying out calculations. Enter a
calculation directly into a print statement:

```py
print(2 + 2)
print(5 + 4 -3)
```

> The spaces around the plus and the minus signs here are **optional**
> (the code would work without them) but they make it easier to read.

Python also carries out multiplication and division, using an **asterisk
\*** to indicate multiplication and a **forward slash /** to indicate
division.

Use **parentheses** to determine which operations are performed first.


```py
print(2*(3+4))
print(10/2)
```


> Using a single slash to divide numbers produces a decimal (or
> ***float***, as it is called in programming). We'll learn more about
> **floats** later.

Dividing by zero produces an **error** in python, as no answer can be
calculated.


```py
 print(11/0)

 Traceback(most recent call last):
  File"\<stdin\>", line 1, in \<module\>
 ZeroDivisionError: division by zero
```


> In python, the last line of an error message indicates the error's
> type. Read error messages carefully, as they often tell you how to fix
> a program!
